Scenario Outline: Creating a new account
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I go to register # define this path mapping in features/support/paths.rb, usually as '/users/sign_up'
    And I fill in "user_email" with "<email>"
    And I fill in "user_password" with "<password>"
    And I fill in "user_password_confirmation" with "<password>"
    And I press "Sign up"
    Then I should see "logged in as <email>" # your work!

    Examples:
      | email           | password   |
      | testing@man.net | secretpass |
      | foo@bar.com     | fr33z3     |

Scenario: Willing to edit my account
    Given I am a new, authenticated user # beyond this step, your work!
    When I want to edit my account
    Then I should see the account initialization form
    And I should see "Your account has not been initialized yet. Do it now!"
    # And more view checking stuff
