Feature: Registration
  As an user
  If i want to access details for chillOut
  i need to register my self with chillOut
  
  Scenario: Creating a new account
  Given I am not authenticated
  When I go to register # define this path mapping in features/support/paths.rb, usually as '/users/sign_up'
    And I fill in "user_email" with "<email>"
    And I fill in "user_password" with "<password>"
    And I fill in "user_password_confirmation" with "<password>"
    And I press "Sign up"
    Then I should see "logged in as <email>" # your work!

    Examples:
      | email           | password   |
      | testing@man.net | secretpass |
      | foo@bar.com     | fr33z3     |
